# Contributing to JustHTML

Thanks for considering contributing to JustHTML! This document explains how to set up your development environment and the standards we follow.

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emilstenstrom/justhtml.git
   cd justhtml
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Running Tests

The test suite uses the html5lib test cases plus additional tests for selector functionality.

If you want to run the full html5lib test suite locally, clone `html5lib-tests` next to this repository and create the symlinks described in [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) (tokenizer, tree-construction, and serializer).

```bash
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run with coverage report
coverage run run_tests.py && coverage report

# Run specific test file
python run_tests.py --test-specs test2.test:5,10 -v

# Quick iteration - test a snippet
python -c 'from justhtml import JustHTML, to_test_format; print(to_test_format(JustHTML("<html>").root))'
```

**Coverage is required to be 100%.** All new code must be fully tested.

## Pre-commit Hooks

Pre-commit runs automatically on every commit and checks:

- **Trailing whitespace** and **end-of-file** formatting
- **YAML** and **TOML** validity
- **Ruff check** - linting with auto-fix
- **Ruff format** - code formatting
- **Tests & Coverage** - full test suite with 100% coverage requirement

Run manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Code Style

We use [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and formatting:

- **Line length**: 119 characters
- **Target**: Python 3.10+
- **Rules**: Nearly all Ruff rules enabled (see `pyproject.toml` for exceptions)

Key style points:
- Use plain `assert` for tests, not `self.assertEqual` etc.
- Comments explain **why**, not **what**
- No typing annotations
- Cite spec sections when relevant (e.g., "Per §13.2.5.72")

## Benchmarking

After making changes, verify performance impact:

```bash
# Quick benchmark
python benchmarks/performance.py --iterations 1 --parser justhtml --no-mem

# Profile hotspots
python benchmarks/profile.py
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Tokenizer** (`tokenizer.py`): HTML5 spec state machine
- **Tree builder** (`treebuilder.py`): Constructs DOM tree following HTML5 rules
- **Node tree** (`node.py`): DOM-like structure, use `append_child()` / `insert_before()`
- **Selector** (`selector.py`): CSS selector matching

Golden rules:
1. Follow WHATWG HTML5 spec exactly
2. No exceptions in hot paths
3. Minimal allocations in tokenizer
4. No `hasattr`/`getattr`/`delattr` - all structures are deterministic
