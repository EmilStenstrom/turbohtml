"""Foster parenting (HTML5 tree construction) centralized implementation.

This module encapsulates logic for choosing the appropriate parent and
insertion position when character data or mis-positioned elements appear
in a table-related context where direct insertion would violate the spec.

The algorithm intentionally avoids performing the actual DOM mutation;
it returns a (parent, before_sibling) tuple for callers to act upon.

Spec Reference (abbrev): When inserting a node and the current node is a
table-related element (table, tbody, tfoot, thead, tr) and the element to
insert is not allowed there, the node should be foster parented: inserted
before the table element in its parent, or if the table has no parent,
after the table in the open elements stack context.

We implement character and element cases with a shared path.
